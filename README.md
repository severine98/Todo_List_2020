# Private To-do List
In order to access their to-do list, a user must either sign up or sign in to the app with their email, Google or Facebook account. They are then redirected to the home page which displays a welcome message, their picture and email they used to sign in. The user can then navigate to their to-do list, which is empty upon their first visit. They are able to add items to their list, cross items out, and delete them. Their to-do list is dynamically being saved, if the user signs out and then signs back in, their to-do list remains the same as they last left it. 

## Purpose of this project
The aim of this project was to get familiar with Firebase and using Authentication in a project. It allowed me to understand more about databases, and apply private routing to a website. The first step of the project was to initalize the authentication by using three sign-in methods. The home page was created in order to practice accessing private information from the user object and rendering them onto the page. The to-do list section initially was not private, and displayed all the items inserted by all users of the app. The final stage of development was to introduce user-specific CRUD functionalities, allowing users to enter data only accessible by themselves. 

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
